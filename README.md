Project Summary
The FAST KA210-SCH Project (2025-2026) aims to develop and implement an innovative
teaching approach to introduce the Holocaust within the context of visual Holocaust
narratives in English Language Teaching to support Global Citizenship Education. The
selected visual literature, picturebooks and graphic novels, centre on Jewish lived
experiences during the Holocaust and will be used as a teaching resource for learners in
upper-primary and lower secondary ELT education (age 10-14) to inspire young global
agents of change using English as a lingua franca.
The FAST Project will select four picturebooks and four graphic novels and develop eight
lesson plans with ELT and cross-curricular activities and a project handbook. The project
will conduct teacher training, pilot materials in-school, finalize and disseminate the
educational resources. These activities will help schools implement a purposeful set of
resources to fight antisemitism, discrimination and hatred and, at the same time, foster
tolerance.
The selected picturebooks and graphic novels will be relevant, historically accurate, and
engaging for English language learners aged 10-14 with a message of hope accompanied
by culturally sensitive lesson plans and activities. The expected results include improved
teaching skills due to targeted training; enhanced engagement, understanding and
developed English language skills of both teachers and learners; wide dissemination of
the resources within educational communities.<br>
